# Arduino
My Arduino assignments:



# Hello_Functions

### Description

Hello Functions is an assignment that uses functions to make a servo move in a direction based on the values given by an ultrasonic sensor. Creating functions allows us to reuse code multiple times with very little problem/
### What I learned
* I learned that functions allow you to use large bits of codes multiple times easily
* I learned that the Arduino has helpful articles about bits of code. In this project, I used an article about [functions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/FunctionDeclaration).

# NewPing 

### Description

NewPing is an assignment that uses the NewPing library to recieve a millisecond value when a button is pressed by using solar.ping(). [NewPing](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/NewPing/) is a library that was created by Tim Eckel to easily code an HC-SR04 sensor.

### What I learned
* I learned how to use the New Ping library
* I learned that the internet has helpful explanations about code
